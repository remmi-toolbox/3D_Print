# About 3D_Print

3D print files are organized in the following manner: Type of holder (i.e. mouse brain holder)> Outer diameter of holder (i.e. 25mm)> Maximum number of samples that can be held within the holder> sldprt (SolidWorks Part) and stl (stereolithography) files

Navigate to the desired holder (i.e. 3D_Print/mouse-brain-holders/25mm/1-mouse-brain) and view the README for a list of parts to print. Additional parts like O-rings and nylon screws may need to be purchased separately. The 3D prints are designed to be compatible with these additional parts.

View the appropriate manual README (i.e. 3D_Print/mouse-brain-holders/mouse-brain-holder-manual/README) for information on holder assembly and usage.
